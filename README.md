# Video-Trigger
A simple script for showing an hiding things around your page based on an html video timeline.
1) Add the "bubble" class to whatever you want to change during the timeline. 
2) Add a new bubble in the video trigger bubbles array
3) Add whatever styles you want. The "bubble" class is the default state, and "show" is the added class for the specified start and finish.
4) There is an "order-" class added to each bubble in the order it is in the array. These are for position. First bubble is "order-0" second is "order-1" and so on.
